Welcome to the Python Concepts repository! This repository is a reflection of my Python learning journey,where I have documented clear and concise examples of fundamental and intermediate programming concepts.
Each script represents a step in my exploration of Python, focusing on specific topics to build a strong foundation incrementally.

### Basics

1. Basics

   * Covers Python syntax, data types, and basic operations.
   * Topics: Numbers, strings, variables, type casting, input/output.

2. Conditions

   * Explores conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else` with examples.
   * Topics: Nested conditions, logical operators.

3. **Loops**

   * Demonstrates loops (`for` and `while`) and common patterns.
   * Topics: Loop control (`break`, `continue`, `pass`), nested loops.

### Data Structures

4. Functions

   * Functions, arguments, return statements, and recursion basics.
   * Topics: Positional arguments, default parameters, keyword arguments.

5. Strings

   * String operations and methods like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.
   * Topics: `f-strings`, `.format()`, regular expressions (optional).

6. Lists

   * Introduction to lists and their manipulation using built-in methods.
   * Topics: Indexing, slicing, list comprehensions.

7. Tuples

   * Covers tuples, their immutability, and common use cases.

8. Sets

   * Set operations including union, intersection, difference, and subset checks.

9. Dictionaries

   * Working with dictionaries, key-value pairs, and common methods.

## Advanced Topics

10. Exception Handling

    * Learned how to handle errors 
    * Topics Covered:
      * The `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
      * Catching specific exceptions vs. generic exceptions.
      * Raising custom exceptions with the `raise` keyword.
      * Use cases where exception handling is crucial for robust programs.

11. Enumerate Example

    * Topics Covered:
      * Automatically numbering elements in an iterable.
      * Combining `enumerate()` with list comprehensions.
      * Customizing the starting index of enumeration.

12. Module Imports

    * Learned the different ways to import Python modules and packages.
    * Topics Covered:
      * The difference between `import module` and `from module import function`.
      * Importing multiple functions and aliases.
      * Exploring Pythonâ€™s standard library (`math`, `datetime`, `os`, etc.).
      * Using third-party libraries and managing them with `pip`.
      * Understanding the `sys.path` and relative imports in project structure.

13. Main Function
    
    * Topics Covered:
      * Writing reusable scripts and modular code.
      * Running scripts as standalone programs or importing them as modules.
      * Debugging and organizing projects using the `main()` function.

14. OS Module

    * Topics Covered:
      * File and directory management (`os.mkdir`, `os.rename`, `os.remove`).
      * Navigating the file system (`os.getcwd`, `os.listdir`, `os.chdir`).
      * Environment variables and system-level commands (`os.getenv`, `os.system`).
      * Cross-platform compatibility using `os.path`.

15. File Handling

    * Topics Covered:
      * Opening files in different modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `r+`).
      * Reading files using `read()`, `readlines()`, and looping over files.
      * Writing and appending data to files.
      * Working with `with open` to handle files safely and avoid memory leaks.
      * Managing binary files and working with JSON or CSV data.

16. Variable Scope

    * Topics Covered:
      * Local variables within a function scope.
      * Using the `global` keyword to modify global variables inside functions.
      * The `nonlocal` keyword for working with nested functions.
      * Practical use cases and pitfalls of variable scoping.

17. Lambda Functions

    * Topics Covered:
      * Writing single-line functions without `def`.
      * Combining lambda functions with Python built-ins like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
      * Using lambdas for sorting and custom key functions.
      * Limitations of lambda functions and when to avoid them.
